# Data Preprocessing and Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks

Description:
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate various stages of data preprocessing and analysis. The notebooks provide step-by-step instructions and code examples for preprocessing raw data, combining multiple datasets into one cohesive dataset, and adding price-based indicators for further analysis.

Notebooks:

Preprocessing Raw Data:
This notebook focuses on the initial preprocessing steps required for raw data. It covers tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation techniques.
Users will learn how to identify and handle outliers, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables if necessary.
The notebook includes code examples and explanations for each preprocessing step.
Combine Multiple Datasets into One:
In this notebook, users will learn how to merge or concatenate multiple datasets into a single dataset. This is useful when dealing with data collected from different sources or time periods.
The notebook demonstrates different merging techniques such as inner join, outer join, left join, and right join.
Users will also learn how to handle duplicate records and perform data validation checks after combining datasets.
Adding Price-Based Indicators:
This notebook focuses on enriching the dataset by adding price-based indicators commonly used in financial analysis.
Users will learn how to calculate and add indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
The notebook provides code examples and explanations for calculating each indicator and visualizing them using plots.

Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the notebooks. You can install Jupyter using pip:
Copy code
pip install notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and navigate to the directory containing the notebooks.
Open the desired notebook (Preprocessing_Raw_Data.ipynb, Combine_Multiple_Datasets.ipynb, or Adding_Price_Based_Indicators.ipynb).
Follow the instructions and execute each cell sequentially to preprocess data, combine datasets, or add price-based indicators.
